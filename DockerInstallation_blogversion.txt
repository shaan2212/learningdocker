Pre-requisites:

1. All the systems where you are going to install docker engine or docker components should be able to ping google.com
2. The DNS must be set to 8.8.8.8
3. The systems must have static IP address and it's good to be in same subnet, so that each system can communicate to other.
4. Update the /etc/hosts with hosts detail on each server.
5. The docker user (user which will run the docker commands) must be the part of admin group (you can make it a part of wheel).


Install using the repository

SET UP THE REPOSITORY

1. Install required packages. yum-utils provides the yum-config-manager utility, and device-mapper-persistent-data and lvm2 are required by the devicemapper storage driver.

$ yum install -y yum-utils device-mapper-persistent-data lvm2

2. Use the following command to set up the stable repository.

$ yum-config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo

3. Install the latest version of Docker Engine - Community and containerd, or go to the next step to install a specific version:

$ yum install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io


Start and enable Docker.

systemctl start docker
systemctl enable docker


Installing docker-compose:

[worker@worker2 ~]$ sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.25.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

[worker@worker2 ~]$ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
[worker@worker2 ~]$ docker-compose --version
docker-compose version 1.25.0, build 0a186604



Uninstallation:

1. Uninstall the Docker package:

$ sudo yum remove docker-ce

2. Images, containers, volumes, or customized configuration files on your host are not automatically removed. To delete all images, containers, and volumes:

$ sudo rm -rf /var/lib/docker

You must delete any edited configuration files manually.
